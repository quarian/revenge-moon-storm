  <h2> 
    Specification of requirements
  </h2>
  <p>
    We plan to implement all the minimun requirements - so we will implement both single player and hotseat
    multiplayer, fog of war on the map, store, collectible treasures, several game rounds, few different terrain
    types (we pitched at leas tar, ice and several thicknes of walls), a random map generator (and possibly
    some kind of procedural map generation in some kind of infinite/survival game mode). Single player game
    naturally comes with some simple AI enemies. Not much special here -
    the game will not be much of anything without these basic features. Fun to play is the main goal and hopefully
    achieved by enough testing and polish.
  </p>
  <p>
    As for the optional requirements we were planning the following. Configurable keys and audio should be easy
    to implement - audio should be supplied by SFML (more on external libraries in the end of the documentation),
    and configurable keys should not be impossible to implement with simple menu selections and the like. More
    intelligent AI is somewhat of an abstract requirement, but we do plan to implement more refined AI than just
    homing towards the player, for example. I can see no reason why AI players could not be supported in multiplayer,
    once some more refined AI is implemented. More weapons and terrain types should be simple to add once a good
    basic implementation of both is done - more on this on the program arcitehcture section. Campaign and map editors
    are in the planning and should not be hard to implement (and making maps by say, writing text files sounds like
    a terrible idea). We do hope that our final map generator fulfills the criteria of beinf "super cool".
  </p>
  <p>
    We discussed the possibility of incorporating netplay or some other type of multiplayer form of play to the game
    but decided that that kind of behaviour should be added once the basic things are in place. We strongly believe
    that by making robust and clean implementations on the basic and more spectacular features we can extend the
    game for multiplayer, for example.
  </p>
  <p> 
    These are, at the moment, the things we have discussed. There is a plenty of work to refine all the mentioned
    features to be excellent, and who knows, maybe we come up with something more exciting in the process.
  </p> 
  <h2> 
    Program architecture
  </h2> 
  <p>
    The following diagram contains the high level architecure view of the program.
    <img src="Architecture.svg" alt="High level arcitecture" width="100%"/>
  </p>
  <p>
    The structure is pretty straightforward - the main class Game maintain the state of the game, Actors represent
    the moving and sentinent things in the game, Map describes the maps games are played in, Items are items to
    be collected and used and so forth.
  </p>
  <p>
    The architectural design is supposed to divide the the program into three quite distinct parts - the
    map and its generation, the actors and the items and the remaining game logic (settings, store and such).
    This makes implementaion on separate parts of the program easy, and on the other hand divides logically
    separate things into their own sets.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the design phase most of the problems we faced and discussed revolved around where the data is stored and
    how it's accessed - for example, when an AI player wants to know what's in the block in front of him, should
    that information be retrieved from the map or the block he is currently at? Should the map contain, for example,
    quick access to player locations or should it just find them once somebody requests them? We ended up storing
    most of the data for players and such in the maps (since map blocks don't necessarily contain references to
    other blocks or objects), so in order to get the location of for example the block in front of a player, we
    would supply the map the location and the facing of the player and receive the thing in the block he's looking
    at.
  </p>
  <h2> 
    Task sharing
  </h2> 
  <p>
    The division of work follows roughly what was drafted in the section above. The following diagram shows the
    larger blocks of the project.
    <img src="TaskSharing.svg" alt="Sweet task sharing blocks" width="100%"/>
  </p>
  <p> 
    Co-operation will be handled by our established IRC-channel and weekly meet ups. Interfaces should be pretty
    clear between the shared tasks - maps have functions to get things in the map, actors have methods to move
    them around, items have methods to use and to be picked up and the game logic will use all these methods
    to keep the game running.
  </p> 
  <h2> 
    Testing
  </h2> 
  <p> 
    Non-trivial aspects of the game will be unit tested (everyone's responsibility to make sure their parts)
    work correctly. Hopefully we will implement a nice test suite to be executed upon build. Of course the
    fun aspect of the requirements will be achieved by testing the game by playing.
  </p> 
  <h2> 
    Schedule
  </h2> 
  <ul> 
    <li> 
      First working prototype (some maps, items, weapons and moving players): 8.11
    </li> 
    <li> 
      More refined version (map generation, monster AI, store, more weapon types): 15.11
    </li> 
    <li> 
      Minimum requirements fulfilled: 22.11
    </li>  
    <li> 
      Sweet graphics and audio: 29.11
    </li> 
    <li>
      5.12-8.12 - Bug fixes and finalization, documentation
    </li>
  </ul> 
  <p> 
    This is a rough, weekly schedule. It's kinda tight, but good results require hard work.
